# Comparitive Analysis of Google Translator and AI4Bharat Translator
## Comparsion of the Translator's(Google Translator and AI4Bharat Translator) based on the BLUE Score and STS Score 

### **Problem Statement :**

In light of Google Translator's inefficiencies with low-resource and certain Indian languages, can we find more effective alternatives to Google Translator?How do these alternatives compare in terms of accuracy and contextual meaning, aiming to deliver superior translations in diverse linguistic contexts?

### **Dataset :** 

Here the dataset was taken from the kaggle which was uploaded by IIT Bombay containing of 10 lakh records of both hindi and english.

### **Methodology :**

The hindi records were passed to two different translators and then translated them into english and then compared the records with the original english texts which were already in the dataset and got the STS Score and then finally picking up the best translator for translating indic to english.
          
### **Google Translator -> NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION (NMT) :**

The core technology behind Google Translate is NMT. NMT uses artificial neural networks trained on massive amounts of bilingual text data. These networks learn the relationships between words and phrases across languages, allowing them to generate translations that are more natural and accurate than traditional methods.

### **AI4Bharat -> Indic-Trans :**

This model is built on the robust Transformer architecture, initially designed for Google Translate and meticulously adapted for Indic languages. It leverages parallelized processing and attention mechanisms, resulting in efficient training and superior performance. Trained on an extensive dataset encompassing all 22 scheduled Indic languages and English, the model adeptly captures language relationships, ensuring precise translations. IndicTrans2 optimizes lexical sharing by employing script unification when possible, seamlessly converting diverse scripts, such as those used in Kashmiri, Manipuri, and Sindhi, to a common script like Devanagari before translation, and reverting them post-translation.

### **Comparsion Metrics -> Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) Scores :**

STS scores quantify the semantic similarity between two text sentences. Measures how closely the meaning of two sentences aligns. STS scores typically range between 0 and 1, representing the degree of semantic similarity between two text pieces.


0     :    No semantic similarity.


0.5   :    Moderate level of similarity.


1     :    Perfect semantic similarity, indicating the two texts convey the same meaning.
